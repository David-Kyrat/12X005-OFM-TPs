Sure! Here is an algorithm for converting a logical formula into Negation Normal Form (NNF) in the F# programming language:

If the formula is a literal (i.e., a variable or its negation), return the formula.
If the formula is of the form "not (A)" where A is a formula, apply the following rules:
If A is a literal, return the negation of A.
If A is of the form "not (B)", where B is a formula, return B.
If A is of the form "and (B, C)", where B and C are formulas, return "or (not (B), not (C))".
If A is of the form "or (B, C)", where B and C are formulas, return "and (not (B), not (C))".
If the formula is of the form "and (A, B)" or "or (A, B)", where A and B are formulas, recursively convert A and B to NNF and return the resulting formula in NNF.
Here is some example F# code that implements this algorithm:


type Formula =
    | Literal of string
    | Not of Formula
    | And of Formula * Formula
    | Or of Formula * Formula

let rec toNNF (formula: Formula) : Formula =
    match formula with
    | Literal x -> Literal x
    | Not f ->
        match f with
        | Literal x -> Not (Literal x)
        | Not g -> g
        | And (g, h) -> Or (Not g, Not h)
        | Or (g, h) -> And (Not g, Not h)
    | And (f, g) -> And (toNNF f, toNNF g)
    | Or (f, g) -> Or (toNNF f, toNNF g)

This code defines a Formula type and a recursive function toNNF that takes a formula and returns its equivalent in NNF. The function pattern matches on the input formula and applies the rules specified in the algorithm.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
